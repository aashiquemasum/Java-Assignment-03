Write a Java program to find the value of specified expression. a. 301 + 0) / 5 b. 7.0e-6 * 10000000.1 c. true && true d. false && true e. (false && false) || (true && true) f. (false || false) && (true && true)
Length and breadth of a rectangle are 9 and 5 respectively. Write a program to calculate the area and perimeter of the rectangle.
Write a program to calculate the perimeter of a triangle having sides of length 9,6 and 5 units.
Write a program to find if both the conditions 'a < 50' and 'a < b' are true when value of a is 45 and b is 67.
Write a program to find total marks and percentage of students when his marks in three subjects are 87, 39 and 52 respectively (each out of 100 ).
Write a program to convert temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius degree. (You can take temperature of your choice)

If num1=5 and num2=4 then write a program to swap values of these numbers.
Write a program to convert positive number to negative number. (You can take any number of your choice)
Consider the following code snippet. arrayOfInts[j] > arrayOfInts[j+1] a. Which operators does the code contain?
Consider the following code snippet. int i = 10; int n = i++%5; a. What are the values of i and n after the code is executed? b. What are the final values of i and n if instead of using the postfix increment operator (i++), you use the prefix version (++i))?
To invert the value of a boolean, which operator would you use?
Write a program to show the difference between postfix expr ++ and prefix ++ expr operators. In the comments of your program explain each line of code.
Write a program to show the difference between postfix expr -- and prefix -- expr operators. In the comments of your program explain each line of code.
Which operator is used to compare two values, = or == ?
Explain the following code sample: result = someCondition ? value1 : value2;
